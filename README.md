# devops-pairing-terraform
Create a tempoary user for use in devops pairing interviewes

## How to use
- Ensure terraform/tfenv is installed
- Run `terraform apply` in the DevOps pairing account (the regular sandbox playground account will not work for this)
- Enter the first name of the interviewee when prompted
- Don't forget to run `terraform destroy` after the candidate has destroyed what they have made
